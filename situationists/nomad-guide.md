# New Babylonian's Guide to Playnet Earth

Familiarize yourself with the following concepts:
- antifragility
- redundancy
- optionality
- free-association
- mutual recognition of contribution towards eachother's self-actualization

## Increasing Optionality :: Becoming Antifragile
- water-backpack :: should be able to carry laptop and have many pockets for other stuff (decathlon). You will be able to move in any direction for days without your spatial movement being dictated by clean water access.
- basic medical kit
- basic hygiene gear: soap, deoderant, toothpaste, toothbrush, etc. (self-care and beauty massively increases your optionality in a variety of settings, and actually deters physical violence)
- multi-vitamin tablets :: you can get them in most pharmacies, and they are very cheap (10 days supply 0.50â‚¬) :: if vegetarian, make sure to get Omega-3 supplements
- 1 tupperware container :: for food storage
- basic eating utensils: fork, knife, spoon, etc.
- skisuit :: very versatile clothing item (many pockets, can be used as a pillow, blanket, etc, protects underlying clothing from getting dirty, allows you to lie down on the ground anywhere without getting the clothes that make contact with your skin dirty) a skisuit additionally allows you to play in the snow!
- bathrobe :: serves as a blanket, pillow, etc.
- extra pairs of socks (most important)
- hat 
- (if you are male, you don't really need underwear)
- phone
- portable charger (ideally the same for both laptop/phone :: usb-a to usb-c gives you the most optionality - including charging at various public charging spots (like cafes, libraries, buses etc.))

### Organization
- index cards / paper
- markers / pens
- small notebook

- a watch :: time can be your greatest enemy or your best friend
- mantain a calendar rigourously :: simply add *options* to your calendar, you dont have to do anything with them! But its nice to have the options!

- utilize offline maps app (google) :: make extensive use of Pins, create your own categories!
- paper map :: you can't get lost if you have a map
- compass :: you can't get lost if you have a compass

### Tools
- strings
- zip ties
- paracord
- duct tape
- small knife
- multi-tool
- lighter / matches
- headphones :: you can listen to podcasts, music, etc. in isolation. (warning: headphones can socially isolate you, and decrease the spontaneity and magic that can happen with more openness to the world! You can play music/podcasts out loud in many cases!)

### Housing
- Free-Association Principles Prevail
- Couchsurfing
- Squats / anarchist networks
