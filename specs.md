# New Babylon DSL: Language Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction and Scope

This document specifies the requirements for a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to enable the modeling, simulation, and dynamic evolution of New Babylonian architectural environments. The language must embody the anti-utilitarian philosophy of New Babylon, privileging creative play and continuous transformation over static, utilitarian structures.

The primary users of this language will be:

- Nomads engaged in dynamic spatial creation and transformation
- Collective groups exploring non-utilitarian, ludic spatial configurations
- Simulationists modeling fluctuating population flows and environmental effects
- Cultural engineers designing spaces for nomadic, creative living

## What's new about this Language?

We have fundamentally reimagined what an architectural domain-specific language can be by breaking free from the property-bound, utilitarian paradigms that have constrained computational thinking in architecture. The New Babylon DSL transcends traditional BIM and parametric design frameworks by embedding space-time continuity directly into its core primitives. Rather than modeling buildings as discrete objects within Cartesian coordinates, our language conceptualizes architecture as interconnected, transformable volumetric fields that exist in a continuous state of becoming. Every primitive—from points to complex sectorial networks—inherently possesses temporal dimensions, allowing architects to work natively in 4D without the artificial separation between spatial and temporal concerns that characterizes conventional architectural computing.

This 4D integration represents a radical departure from existing computational approaches to architectural temporality, which typically treat time as a sequence of discrete states or keyframes between which interpolation occurs. In New Babylon DSL, time is not an external parameter applied to geometric models but an intrinsic dimension of the model itself. Our transformation functions operate directly on 4D manifolds, enabling topological continuity across temporal states rather than mere geometric translation, rotation, or scaling in 3D space followed by state changes. Consider the simple operation of transforming a volume: in conventional systems, we translate coordinates, then change parameters at different timesteps. In our framework, we directly manipulate 4D geometric tensors along temporal vectors, producing continuous deformation fields rather than state transitions. This means that architects can mathematically describe architectural elements that possess inherent behavioral properties—volumes that expand in response to social density, surfaces that modulate permeability based on environmental conditions, and boundaries that blur and sharpen according to changing privacy needs. The language thus models not just what architecture is at any given moment, but the continuous field of what it is becoming.

## 2. Core Language Requirements

### 2.1 Distributed Object Model

The language shall implement a distributed actor-based object model where:

- Each architectural element is a persistent, addressable actor

# Creating Structure with 4D Geometric Primitives and Volumetric Fields

In practice, creating structures using 4D geometric primitives and volumetric fields of potential transformation would fundamentally change the architectural design process. Here's how it would work:

## 1. Defining 4D Primitives

Instead of drawing a wall as a static 3D object, you would define it as a 4D entity with an inherent temporal dimension:

```scheme
(define-wall "living-space-boundary"
  #:base-geometry (polygon [[0,0,0], [5,0,0], [5,3,0], [0,3,0]])
  #:height 3
  #:temporal-behavior (lambda (t)
                        (cond
                          [(social-density-exceeds? 'adjacent-zone 25 t)
                           (transform #:permeability 0.8 #:transparency 0.9)]
                          [(privacy-needed? 'adjacent-zone t)
                           (transform #:permeability 0.1 #:transparency 0.2)]
                          [else (transform #:permeability 0.4 #:transparency 0.6)])))
```

This wall isn't just a static barrier but a responsive membrane that changes its properties based on contextual conditions over time.

## 2. Working with Volumetric Fields

Rather than designing discrete spaces, you would define volumetric fields with properties that vary continuously through space:

```scheme
(define-spatial-field "activity-zone"
  #:boundary (sphere [10,15,2] 8)
  #:properties
  (field-composition
    (acoustic-absorption-field
      (gradient-from-center [0.2 0.8]))
    (light-intensity-field
      (lambda (x y z t)
        (+ 0.3 (* 0.6 (sin (/ t 3600))))))
    (air-movement-field
      (vector-field-from-points
        [[8,15,2] [0,0,1] 0.2]
        [[12,15,2] [0,0,-1] 0.2]))))
```

This defines a spherical zone where multiple environmental properties vary continuously through space and change over time.

## 3. Transformation Potentials

Instead of fixed forms, you would define transformation potentials—how spaces can morph in response to different stimuli:

```scheme
(define-transformation-field "flex-space"
  #:initial-volume (box [0,0,0] [8,12,3])
  #:transformation-potential
  (compose-potentials
    (expansion-potential
      #:direction [1,0,0]
      #:max-extent 5
      #:trigger 'gathering-size-exceeds 15)
    (subdivision-potential
      #:axis 'y
      #:max-divisions 3
      #:trigger 'activity-differentiation)
    (connection-potential
      #:target "adjacent-space"
      #:location 'dynamic
      #:trigger 'circulation-intensity-exceeds 25)))
```

This encodes not just what a space is, but how it can transform, creating a field of architectural possibilities rather than a single fixed design.

## 4. Designing with Chain Reactions

You would design interaction patterns where one transformation triggers others, creating emergent behaviors:

```scheme
(define-chain-reaction "social-cascade"
  #:initial-trigger (user-modification "central-zone")
  #:propagation-rules
  (list
    (propagation-rule
      #:condition 'adjacency
      #:probability 0.7
      #:delay (seconds 20)
      #:transformation-type 'similar)
    (propagation-rule
      #:condition 'visibility
      #:probability 0.4
      #:delay (seconds 45)
      #:transformation-type 'complementary)))
```

This defines how a change in one area might cascade through the environment, creating emergent patterns that weren't explicitly designed.

## 5. Integration with Social Dynamics

Your designs would actively incorporate how people use space as a defining element:

```scheme
(define-social-responsive-volume "gathering-space"
  #:initial-geometry (cylinder [15,15,0] 6 3)
  #:density-response
  (lambda (density t)
    (cond
      [(< density 5) (contract-to-paths density)]
      [(< density 15) (optimize-for-small-groups density)]
      [(< density 30) (expand-for-gathering density)]
      [else (create-sub-zones density)]))
  #:activity-response
  (lambda (activities t)
    (adapt-environment-to-activities activities)))
```

This creates a space that physically transforms in response to how many people are using it and what they're doing.

## 6. Practical Implementation Challenges

Implementing these concepts would require:

- **Computational power**: Simulating continuous 4D fields is computationally intensive
- **New interfaces**: Traditional design interfaces are inadequate; you'd need tools that visualize potential states and transformations
- **Structural systems**: Physical implementation would require adaptive structural systems using soft robotics, programmable materials, or modular assemblies
- **Sensors and actuators**: Real-time sensing of social dynamics and environmental conditions would be necessary
- **Distributed intelligence**: Local decision-making systems would be needed to process transformations without central control

The resulting architecture would exist as much as a continuously evolving process as it would a physical form, blurring the boundaries between designer, user, and environment in a way that fundamentally challenges our current understanding of what architecture is.
